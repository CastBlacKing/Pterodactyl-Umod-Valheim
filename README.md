# Pterodactyl
Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. Designed with security in mind, Pterodactyl runs all game servers in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful and intuitive UI to end users. 

# Game
https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/

A battle-slain warrior, the Valkyries have ferried your soul to Valheim, the tenth Norse world. Besieged by creatures of chaos and ancient enemies of the gods, you are the newest custodian of the primordial purgatory, tasked with slaying Odinâ€™s ancient rivals and bringing order to Valheim.

# How to use

To use this script, just do as any other, however there are a few things that must be followed.

1. When you install a server and choose the port, you must release the next port also, example: 2456 and 2457
2. This EGG was tested on Pterodactyl version 0.7, we are working on 1.0 version.
